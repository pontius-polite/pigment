Color Dynamics: linear and sinusoidal

Ant Properties: 

x, y, size, shape
xSpeed, ySpeed
color
lifeTime - frames this ant has been alive
timeCreated - timestamp for when ant was created, used in priority queue to remove



Solution to ugly switch:

ant.update = behavior["fungus"];

behavior = {
	fungus: function(x, y){...},
	crystal: function(x, y){...},
	...
}

ant.update(x, y);
